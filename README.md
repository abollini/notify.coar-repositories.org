## About COAR Notify
The [*COAR Notify Initiative*](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify/) is developing and accelerating community adoption of a standard, interoperable, and decentralised approach (using Linked Data Notifications) to link research outputs hosted in the distributed network of repositories with resources from external services, such as overlay-journals and open peer review services.
